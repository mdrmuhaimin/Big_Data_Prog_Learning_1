What happened to the HDFS file when one of the nodes it was stored on failed?
Ans.
When one node with the replica file stored on failed, initially hadoop shows the files availability only on the three other nodes.
However eventually hadoop replace the downed node with another node to make it available on four nodes. To test it further I also closed down one extra node to make total alive node only three,
in that case though it shows replication factor four hadoop shows availability only on three nodes.

How did YARN/MapReduce behave when one of the compute nodes disappeared?
Ans.
Firstly it shows appropriate error messages: in commandline it successfully able to tell that the node and associated executors has been disappeard (Lost task 45.0 in stage 4.0 (TID 355, hadoop3, executor 3)). Then it also pass the information
that this node's container which holding the task has been marked as failed. In the web frontend it shows an error that it can't find address for the associated executors.

Error recovery: To make sure the process runs perfectly hadoop distribute the task with other available executors. In my experiment I made node three to fail. It was assigned 16 total task out of which it only able to complete
eight, so the remaining tasks were distributed amongst the healthy executors. Here is the breakdown of which executor did how many tasks
 ----------------------------------------
|    Name    |  Address   | Success/Fail |
|----------------------------------------|
| Executor 1 | (hadoop 4) |   (20/20)    |
|----------------------------------------|
| Executor 2 | (hadoop 5) |   (24/24)    |
|----------------------------------------|
| Executor 3 | (hadoop 3) |   (08/16)    |
|            | (Missing N)|              |
|----------------------------------------|
| Executor 4 | (hadoop 2) |   (24/24)    |
|----------------------------------------|
| Executor 5 | (hadoop 1) |   (24/24)    |
 ----------------------------------------
Total 100 tasks.


Were there more things you'd like to try with this cluster, or anything you did try that you think should have been in this assignment?
Ans.
It would be intesting if we can get to try how this works in cloud situation. For example instead of a physcial cluster we could put them in AWS and deploy them in across region. One scenario would be really interesting to see if we suddenly stop
all the instances in one region(by shutting down all instances associated with that zone.) we can observe whethere hadoop transfer those in a separate region and how it affect performance. I remember at the beginning of this year one of the AWS data center in North
America failed and it disrupt global internet based application as they were deployed in those zone. It would be interesting to see how hadoop handle with that.
