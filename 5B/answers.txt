What is your best guess for the slope and intercept of the streaming points being produced?
Intercept 23.6 and Slope 14.59

Is your streaming program's estimate of the slope and intercept getting better as the program runs? (That is: is the program aggregating all of the data from the start of time, or only those that have arrived since the last output?)
Yes the program aggregating all of the data from the start of time, initially intercept varies between 22.5 ~ 23.7 however slope remains 15.57 ~ 14.59 but as more data comes its variation reduce significantly

In the colour classification question, which pipeline gave the best results? What was the score and what parameters did you use to get it?
The following pipeline yields the best result.
'LAB-MLP', Pipeline(stages=[sqlTrans, lab_assembler, indexer, mlp]),
Score: LAB-MLP 0.7008671198142774 Parameters: maxIter=100, layers=[3, 250, 11]
Here is the overall score for all the other algorithms
RGB-forest 0.6812831330741141 - numTrees=25, maxDepth=20, seed=42
LAB-forest 0.6652508743958273 - numTrees=25, maxDepth=20, seed=42
RGB-MLP 0.6616559421638154 - maxIter=200, layers=[3, 250, 11]
LAB-MLP 0.7008671198142774 - maxIter=200, layers=[3, 250, 11]

Why is your temperature predictor better than the one in the example? What strategy did you use to find it?
Because their is not a linear relationship between the features and target class. That is why using linear regression is not a best option.
So I used a classifier that can predict non linearly separable data, ensemble decision tree, random forest classifier gives us a better result than linear regression.
