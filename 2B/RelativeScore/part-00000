I have to retake the electricity and magnetism portion of intro physics again because the course at my university that covers those topics also covers thermodynamics, something not covered in AP high school course.  Still, the way this class is taught (by a professor who was featured on Reddit recently), it goes way beyond what I learned last year.\n\nAlso, the classes that are really interesting *are* the prerequisite.  For example, that CS class is [SICP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicp)-based, and goes over both things I know and things that I never thought I would learn.  Near the end, we used an open-source implementation of [Google's Mapreduce](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapreduce) to do distributed, massively-parallel processing of huge datasets (like all of Shakespeare's works).  This is in literally the first class you're expected to take as a CS major.\n\nI'm not trying to brag or say you're wrong.

Do not think for a single second that abolishing unions would lead to anything other than total ruin for the middle class in the long run - I've seen it happen time and time again. When your job is commoditized (e.g. any monkey with 10 hours of training can do it) rampant abuse becomes commonplace very shortly. There *does* need to be some protection against unscrupulous employers.\n\nThat being said, I agree with you. The CAW in this case is just being stupid and shortsighted - the entire auto industry is in the hole, and without a significant reduction in labour costs the industry will simply *vanish*. Yes, it sucks to get a pay cut, but it's that or perish entirely, and it's puzzling how they can't seem to grasp that.\n\nI will have to object to your seemingly elitist view that education somehow justifies your salary. Work is, and ought to be, paid on the basis of value generated for the employer. The fact that you are a high school dropout vs. a PhD in astrophysics has nothing to do with it. I know auto workers who work their tails off, and I also know educated office workers who don't do shit. If you're making an awful lot of money for your employer you ought to be compensated for it.\n\nI suggest you tune your world view a bit and take your head out of the clouds - spend some time down at the level where the blue collar folk live, I think your perspective will change. The production and manufacturing sector of the Canadian economy is vital to our nation's health, and I would thank you not to look down upon them all as greedy opportunistic idiots, and stop dehumanizing these people.\n\nFYI: I'm an university-educated engineer who spent a good deal of time working in an auto plant. I'm *actually* privy to the numbers w.r.t. how much financial value each production employee provides to the company. Let's just say they're worth far more than $20/hr. And let me also say that their job is far from easy.", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": "1229849991", "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "1x16", "link_id": "t3_7kqx1", "name": "t1_1x16", "parent_id": "t1_1rm1", "retrieved_on": 1428219336, "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "canada", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "ups": 2}

Seriously. Get off your high horse and visit an auto plant; look at what they do there, it's a lot more than tightening bolts. I've worked in one, and I can tell you that their jobs are not as easy as you think.\n\n2 - The \"bolt tightener\" is also not making $70 an hour. The figure *includes* all employment benefits, and in fact is an American number that is a fair bit higher than its Canadian counterpart. In the auto plant where I worked, the average line worker was making $20-35 an hour.\n\n3 - Bolt tighteners *are* getting the market rate. There *is* artificial inflation caused by union negotiations, but your ridiculous exaggeration of the numbers show your biases and your ignorance. In fact, compare the average pay at a GM plant vs. at a Canadian Toyota plant, and you will see that non-union and union labour do not get paid that differently.\n\nThe failure of the big 3 is based on an inability to adapt to changing market conditions, and a boneheaded management structure that stifles the type of innovation necessary to pull them out of the slump. Yes, the inflexibility of union labour does complicate this issue, and has held back the ability for GM et al to adapt, but to blame it as the sole (or even primary) cause is ignorant.\n\nOh, by the way, \"cost control\" is part of what got GM into this mess to begin with. Moving production into Mexico created a PR nightmare when all the shitty parts started failing (whereas the Toyotas kept ticking, not using sub-standard parts made by $1/hr labourers). When I was working in the industry, GM was notorious for squeezing its suppliers for every single penny they got for parts - and this translated into several embarrassing recalls, and generally much poorer quality vehicles.", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": "1229850625", "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "1x4j", "link_id": "t3_7kqx1", "name": "t1_1x4j", "parent_id": "t1_1ild", "retrieved_on": 1428219337, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "canada", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "ups": 1}

GM isn't having problems with *profit margins*, they're having problems *selling any cars at all*.\n\nBased on my own time in the industry, and those of my friends who are still there, I think GM would do well with the following:\n\n1 - Stop cheaping out on parts. Stop doing things in Mexico, just stop. Toyota is stuffing their cars with high-quality, reliable parts, whereas GM has repeatedly tried to undercut their competition's price by throwing in sub-standard crap that does them more harm than good in the long run.\n\n2 - Increase the quality control for interior components. When I sit in a Toyota I feel like it's properly put together. When I sit in a GM car I feel cheap - the material is cheap, the dashboard is tacky plastic, the individual interior panels don't fit together. If you want your customers to buy your cars, at least make it look like it was put together with some care.\n\n3 - Abandon the current marketing strategy. *It does not work*. I hate the ads that come on TV with a guy talking a mile a minute about no money down, no interest loans on a GM truck. I don't care.

You're mis-representing your opponent's argument by setting-up a ridiculous position which, while superficially resembling rainman's, is not what s/he said at all.\r\n\r\nYou asserted that because rainman can see the advantages of an appointed senate (but not necessarily in its current form), then rainman is also advocating an appointed Commons.\r\n\r\n &gt; I argue against the anti-democratic nature of the Senate\r\n\r\nIt is not anti-democratic if the Senate works _with_ a democratically elected Commons. Particularly if it only has limited power, for example: the Senate should only be allowed to block a bill a finite number of times.\r\n\r\n &gt; and the people that support the continuation of that anti-democratic process, like yourself.\r\n\r\nAh, the 'Support Our Troops' fallacy. I disagree with you therefore I hate freedom, don't support the troops, or some such other bollocks. This sentence speaks more of your inability to see other's point-of-view than my support for an 'anti-democratic' process.\r\n\r\n &gt; Either elect Senators, or more prefereably abolish the Senate.

Joking aside, I wouldn't disagree with either of these options, provided reforms were based around a discussion on first-principles. That's really what's missing here: a discussion of _what the Senate is for_. Creating another elected chamber, the same as the first, is a waste of time and money.\r\n\r\nAs for not wanting an un-elected body to temper the will of the Commons, I disagree. Checks and balances are a good thing, as long as the upper chamber only has limited power, essentially the ability to say: 'But what about ...' or to delay a bill long enough to draw public opinion and debate around the subject. Too often we see certain governments pushing bills through around holiday time or during a crisis, stopping proper oversight.\r\n\r\n &gt; Frankly, I find that this notion of a \"sober second thought\" to smack of elitism; the idea that the people's chamber isn't one we can trust, and that we need overseers to temper it.\r\n\r\nI can understand why you would feel this way, particularly with the current setup. However I would argue that the elected chamber absolutely does need oversight, preferably by experts in areas a piece of legislation covers. An example from Britain (that I've mentioned in past debates) is [42 days detention](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7666022.stm). The government couldn't stand up to ex-heads of MI5 and police chiefs in the Lords telling them their legislation was un-needed.\r\n\r\nAs a bonus point: members of an appointed chamber have no fear in addressing divisive issues, which no elected member would touch with a barge-pole for fear of losing votes.", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": "1229973263", "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": true, "gilded": 0, "id": "2nwr", "link_id": "t3_7kr5d", "name": "t1_2nwr", "parent_id": "t1_2kt5", "retrieved_on": 1428219684, "score": 1, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "canada", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "ups": 1}

Theoretically, when the house went back in September, Harper was still waiting on the results of 4 by-elections to decide whether he was going to call an election or not, so it would have made sense for him not to rock the boat at that time.  It wasn't a really huge surprise when he decided to call an election before the by-elections happened, and I think that the results bore out his decision to a certain extent. \n\nMy basic disagreement is the level of dishonesty that he's shown about what he's campaigned on, and what he does, which is only emphasized by this decision.  He had from last April-July (at least) to go through the process of appointing a new judge in accordance with the process that **he** had advocated (all-party Parliamentary committee), and he chose not to. (That's assuming that he had no prior notice of Bastarache's resignation in advance, which I would find very difficult to believe, as that would be pretty irresponsible on both sides.  I think that it's relatively unlikely for a Supreme Court judge not to at least give a courtesy reach-around to the Prime Minister a week or two in advance).  \n\nI guess that what it comes down to is I don't trust Harper, but even more than that, he scares me.  I've always been a bit left-wing- I was an adult when Mike Harris was in office in Ontario, and when Mulroney took office, and both of them together convinced me that staying away from the Conservatives wasn't necessarily a bad idea considering the values that I think are important when voting for a local representative as well as a provincial/federal one. That said, I rarely thought that either of them were actually evil.  I have many good friends who are, and have always been Conservatives (even before and after the Reform Party), and will probably always be Conservatives, and that's fine with me.  Life is boring and useless if everyone agrees on everything (even in Canada).  I have still never seen anything like the last six months of Canadian politics.  I've never thought that Conservatives wear horns and red capes under their suits, and while I've often thought that they were misguided, we're all Canadians and Canadians are nice people, so I figured that it would all work out. \n\nI don't think that we're on the brink of fascism, I don't think that life as we know it as Canadians is going to change overnight, but the secrecy and the political manipulation that's going on at the moment is absolutely shit scary, and people are falling for it hook, line, and sinker.  It doesn't even seem to fall along geographical lines anymore- I've got well-educated and less-educated friends from all ends of the political system all over the country, and almost without exception, the less-educated people believe that a coalition is \"not legal and not part of our system\", and that Harper was only acting in the best interests of the country by proroguing Parliament because anything else would be against our Constitution.  \n\nWhile I realize that I'm broadening this specific conversation, IF Harper and the Conservatives wanted to have a real dialogue about what is right for the country, they would at *the very least* spend some of their ad money on basic education. Instead, they're getting everything they can out of it. I realize that's part of the antagonistic political system that we rapidly seem to be co-opting from the U.S., but it just sucks.   This Supreme Court appointment seems to me to just be another symptom of what's going extremely wrong in our system at the moment.  \n\n\n\n", "controversiality": 0, "created_utc": "1230060894", "distinguished": null, "downs": 0, "edited": false, "gilded": 0, "id": "3blp", "link_id": "t3_7l4dm", "name": "t1_3blp", "parent_id": "t1_3aiv", "retrieved_on": 1428219992, "score": 2, "score_hidden": false, "subreddit": "canada", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh68", "ups": 2}

This is anecdotal, I know, but I am opposed to the coalition, and I have a bachelor's degree and have almost completed my Master's. So you can call me ignorant and wrong, but not uneducated. I went to a rally opposed to the coalition. I had conversations with ~10 people. All of them were in positions of work where I can say with 95% certainty that they had a post-secondary degree. Half of them were professionals.\n\nThe opposite argument could (and has) been made naively: that the supporters of the coalition are over-educated people without any sense of the real world. I think both these statements referring to education does nothing but to vilify \"the other side\" and cloud the issue.\n\nI actually kind of thought you would bring up the coalition, which is why I included the last sentence of my previous comment.

Many Supreme Court or provincial Court of Appeal judges have been appointed by more than one government, of different political stripes.

In other words, the vetting process is aimed at solving a problem which does not exist.\n\n3) All that said, this is another example of Harper ignoring his firm commitments and promises when it suits him to do so - fixed terms, elected senates, no deficit, and so on.

The last place we checked, The Powder Springs Motel, gave us a map with a list of every accommodation in Revelstoke, after phoning them all we ascertained there were no rooms available.

Assume fullterm is 40. 40-16 = 24 weeks. Therefore, 3% of abortions were performed in this 24 week period of pregnancies\n\nAssuming that the relationship between number of abortions and where you are in the pregnancy is linear, and that the third-trimester occurs at 28wks, 40-28=12, 12/24 = 0.5.  0.5*3%=1.5%\n\nThis would imply that only 1.5% of all abortions are third-trimester.\n\nHowever, the relationship between abortion frequency and pregnancy-stage is not in fact linear (I challenge you to use your google skills to discover this for yourself!) - it's actually negatively exponential.
